This rule detects when an unauthenticated user request is authorized within the cluster. Attackers may attempt to use
anonymous accounts to gain initial access to the cluster or to avoid attribution of their activities within the cluster.
This rule excludes the /healthz, /livez and /readyz endpoints which are commonly accessed anonymously.
