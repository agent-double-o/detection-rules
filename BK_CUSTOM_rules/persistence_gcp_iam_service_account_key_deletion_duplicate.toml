Identifies the deletion of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account key in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Each service account is associated with two sets of public/private RSA key pairs that are used to authenticate. If a key
is deleted, the application will no longer be able to access Google Cloud resources using that key. A security best
practice is to rotate your service account keys regularly.
