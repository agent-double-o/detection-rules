This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a
sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this
mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem
can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods.

    An administrator may need to attach a hostPath volume for a legitimate reason. This alert should be investigated for
    legitimacy by determining if the kuberenetes.audit.requestObject.spec.volumes.hostPath.path triggered is one needed
    by its target container/pod. For example, when the fleet managed elastic agent is deployed as a daemonset it creates
    several hostPath volume mounts, some of which are sensitive host directories like /proc, /etc/kubernetes, and
    /var/log. Add exceptions for trusted container images using the query field
