Identifies the enable of the full user-mode dumps feature system-wide. This feature allows Windows Error Reporting (WER)
to collect data after an application crashes. This setting is a requirement for the LSASS Shtinkering attack, which
fakes the communication of a crash on LSASS, generating a dump of the process memory, which gives the attacker access to
the credentials present on the system without having to bring malware to the system. This setting is not enabled by
default, and applications must create their registry subkeys to hold settings that enable them to collect dumps.
