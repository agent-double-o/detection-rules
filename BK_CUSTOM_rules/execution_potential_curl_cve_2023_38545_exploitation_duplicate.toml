description = """
Detects potential exploitation of curl CVE-2023-38545 by monitoring for vulnerable command line arguments in conjunction
with an unusual command line length. A flaw in curl version <= 8.3 makes curl vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow
during the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. Upgrade to curl version >= 8.4 to patch this vulnerability. This exploit can be
executed with and without the use of environment variables. For increased visibility, enable the collection of
http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY and ALL_PROXY environment variables based on the instructions provided in the setup guide of
this rule.
